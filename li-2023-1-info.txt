AB Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a long-lasting broad-spectrum plant defense mechanism induced in distal systemic tissues by mobile signals generated at the primary infection site. Despite the discoveries of multiple potential mobile signals, how these signals cooperate to trigger downstream SAR signaling is unknown. Here, we show that endogenous extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) [eNAD(P)] accumulates systemically upon pathogen infection and that both eNAD(P) and the lectin receptor kinase (LecRK), LecRK-VI.2, are required in systemic tissues for the establishment of SAR. Moreover, putative mobile signals, e.g., N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP), trigger de novo systemic eNAD(P) accumulation largely through the respiratory burst oxidase homolog RBOHF-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, NHP-induced systemic immunity mainly depends on ROS, eNAD(P), LecRK-VI.2, and BAK1, indicating that NHP induces SAR primarily through the ROS-eNAD(P)-LecRK-VI.2/BAK1 signaling pathway. Our results suggest that mobile signals converge on eNAD(P) in systemic tissues to trigger SAR through LecRK-VI.2.
   Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a plant immune response triggered by mobile signals generated at the primary infection site. Here the authors show that one such mobile signal, N-hydroxypipecolic acid, can trigger production of eNAD(P) that activates SAR through the LecRK-VI.2 receptor.
