AB Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a plant immune response established in uninfected leaves after colonization of local leaves with biotrophic or hemibiotrophic pathogens. The amino acid-derived metabolite N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP) travels from infected to systemic leaves, where it activates salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis through the isochorismate pathway. The resulting increased SA levels are essential for induction of a large set of SAR marker genes and full SAR establishment. In this study, we show that pharmacological treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana with NHP induces a subset of SAR-related genes even in the SA induction-deficient2 (sid2/isochorismate synthase1) mutant, which is devoid of NHP-induced SA. NHP-mediated induction is abolished in sid2-1 NahG plants, in which basal SA levels are degraded. The SA receptor NON-EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1 (NPR1) and its interacting TGACG SEQUENCE-SPECIFIC BINDING PROTEIN (TGA) transcription factors are required for the NHP-mediated induction of SAR genes at resting SA levels. Isothermal titration analysis determined a K-D of 7.9 +/- 0.5 mu M for the SA/NPR1 complex, suggesting that basal levels of SA would not bind to NPR1 unless yet unknown potentially NHP-induced processes increase the affinity. Moreover, the nucleocytoplasmic protein PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 is required for a slight NHP-mediated increase in NPR1 protein levels and NHP-induced expression of SAR-related genes. Our experiments have unraveled that NHP requires basal SA and components of the SA signaling pathway to induce SAR genes. Still, the mechanism of NHP perception remains enigmatic.
